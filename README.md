# Pomodoro Timer
A very simple pomodoro timer implemented using Python and experimenting with Tkinter to create GUI Applications.

## Set up
You will need Python3 to run this application. To set up, simply clone/download the repo and on terminal write `python3 main.py`.

**Note:** make sure you are using Tkinter version 8.5+. If you are running from macOS, there might be issues due to the built in Tkinter (8.5). To solve this issue, please run this script with non built-in Python e.g. brew or pyenv.
